# Annotation Process

1. **Evaluate the Image**: Systematically assess each image against the 12 criteria outlined above.
2. **Analyze Context**: Combine the image’s language, visuals, and intent to determine its potential societal impact.
3. **Record Judgments**:
   - Label each image as either “Harmful” or “Non-Harmful.”
   - Provide a brief rationale for the decision (e.g., “Includes racial stereotypes” or “No evident harmful elements”).
4. **Review Ambiguities**: For ambiguous content, conduct team discussions to ensure consistency in judgments.
